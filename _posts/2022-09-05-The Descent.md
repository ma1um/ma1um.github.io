The Descent is a soundscape produced from a reverb study conducted in the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen for my Studio Recording class. Samples were recorded on a Zoom H4N Pro during a call and response improv session using resonator bells and chanting. These samples were then brought into Ableton and combined with convolution reverb to produce this soundscape. Certain samples near the end of the piece were processed through my modular synth by conbining multiple signals with the Make Noise MATHS module and passing them through several layers of filters and distortion.

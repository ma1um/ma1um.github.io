Materials: Casette tape

The Gift is a customized for a classmate in my Immersive Experience Design class at MICA. This experience was designed after several interviews with said classmate. I wanted to convey feelings of nostalgia and longing by using sounds of Korea and instructions read in korean directing the student on what to do while listening. (Note: The student was from Korea and talked about missing home and the challenges they faced coming to an American university) The whole experience was packaged on a cassette tape to further invoke the sense of nostalgia and to package the whole gift into a physical package. 

The music present in the experience is a combination of original and edited/manipulated songs added after interviews with my classmate.

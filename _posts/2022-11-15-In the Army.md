Materials: Metal sheet and pencil rod, found objects, speaker

In the Army is a combination sculpture and performance piece confronting the idealistic projection of the military in contrast with the reality of the military industrial complex. The main elements of this piece include the speaker shoulder mount, an authentic U.S army gas mask, and 2 gun welded gun props. 
These elements were combined with a sound element of compiled and manipulated U.S Army commercials projected from the speaker and thus, the wearer. During the duration of the performance, I stood in a trance like state with my figure obstructed with military wear, representing the faceless nature, and unaccountability of the military and its actions.
